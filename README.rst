Ecco is a python library for explaining Natural Language Processing models using interactive visualizations.

It provides multiple interfaces to aid the explanation and intuition of `Transformer
<https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/>`_-based language models. Read: `Interfaces for Explaining Transformer Language Models <https://jalammar.github.io/explaining-transformers/>`_.

Ecco runs inside Jupyter notebooks. It is built on top of `pytorch
<https://pytorch.org/>`_ and `transformers
<https://github.com/huggingface/transformers>`_.

The library is currently an alpha release of a research project. You're welcome to contribute to make it better. 

Installation
============


.. code-block:: python

    # Assuming you had PyTorch previously installed
    pip install ecco


Documentation
=============


To use the project:

.. code-block:: python

    import ecco

    # Load pre-trained language model.
    lm = ecco.from_pretrained('distilgpt2')

    # Input text
    text = "The countries of the European Union are:\n1. Austria\n2. Belgium\n3. Bulgaria\n4."

    # Generate 20 tokens to complete the input text.
    output = lm.generate(text, generate=20, do_sample=True)

This does the following:

1. It loads a pretrained Huggingface DistilGPT2 model. It wraps it an ecco ``LM`` object that does useful things (e.g. it calculates input saliency, can collect neuron activations).
2. We tell the model to generate 20 tokens.
3. The model returns an ecco ``OutputSeq`` object. This object holds the output sequence, but also a lot of data generated by the generation run, including the input sequence and input saliency values. If we set ``activations=True`` in ``from_pretrained()``, then this would also contain neuron activation values.
4. ``output`` can now produce various interactive explorables. Examples include:

- ``output.saliency()`` to generate input saliency explorable [`Input Saliency Colab Notebook <https://colab.research.google.com/github/jalammar/ecco/blob/main/notebooks/Ecco_Input_Saliency.ipynb>`_]
- ``output.run_nmf()`` to to explore non-negative matrix factorization of neuron activations  [`Neuron Activation Colab Notebook <https://colab.research.google.com/github/jalammar/ecco/blob/main/notebooks/Ecco_Neuron_Factors.ipynb>`_]
